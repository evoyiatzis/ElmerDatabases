# ElmerDatabases

It is a collection of xml files in "Elmer"-compatible format with material's properties. Currently, there are two files:

- vapor_database.xml with the viscosity, heat capacity and heat conductivity of roughly 330 substances in SI units. The mathematical expressions and the parameters are described in "Perry's Chemical Engineers Handbook" 9th edition 2nd chapter
- liquid_database.xml with the density, viscosity, heat capacity and heat conductivity of roughly 330 substances in SI units.  The mathematical expressions and the coefficients are described in "Perry's Chemical Engineers Handbook" 9th edition 2nd chapter

These properties are most relevant for heat and mass transfer simulations. If you wish to expand these databases with other properties (such as mechanical ones) and you have a source with the expressions and parameters, feel free to contact me.
